====

A koa.js server app + HTML5 Mobile app (android/ios) that creates and stores qr code on server as well as stores request information in mongodb.t


To run the server , use koa-cluster.

TO compile the app, in Intel XDK , port the mob folder and simply build the app. 

This app was done over a weekend , so If you find anything that can be done better and doesn't work as its supposed to be, feel free to open a issue or pull a request.
